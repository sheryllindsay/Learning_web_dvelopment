			<p>The dating scene has been changing over the last decade. According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project, approximately 6% of Internet users who are in a marriage or other committed relationship met online, compared to 3% who reported this in 2005. Additionally, 42% of Americans know someone who has used an online dating site or app, an increase of 11% from 2005, and 29% of Americans know someone who has met their partner through this medium, compared with 15% who made this claim in 2005.
			<br>
			This data represents a significant shift in the perception of online dating, suggesting that the stigma associated with the practice is dropping:

			59% of Internet users feel that online dating is a good way to meet people (compared with 44% in 2005),
			53% of Internet users feel that online dating is a good means of finding someone with shared interests (compared with 47% in 2005), and
			21% of Internet users feel that employing an online dating service is a mark of desperation, which is down from the reported 29% in 2005.
			Despite these signs of growing acceptance, an undercurrent of hesitation and uncertainty persists when it comes to online relationships:

			54% of online daters believe that someone else has presented false information in their profile,
			and 28% have been contacted in a way that left them feeling harassed or uncomfortable.
			While some of us may Friend more discriminately than others, we live in a time where it's common to build online networks that include secondary and tertiary connections. So don't look so sheepish if you've ever added your friend's aunt's step-brother's son or a random bartender or significant other of a friend you haven't spoken to since high school to one of your online networks—you aren't alone! We've actually been taught that this makes us good networkers—even thought it overlooks quality in favor of quantity—because the objective is to cast as wide a net as possible when building a network. But in this social strategy, how do we know that anyone is who they claim to be?</p>
